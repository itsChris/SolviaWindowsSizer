# Solvia Windows Resizer

Solvia Windows Resizer is a .NET 4.8 Windows Forms application designed to enhance productivity and streamline window management on Windows operating systems. This tool is particularly useful for web designers and developers working on large monitors, as it allows for precise resizing of application windows to specific dimensions, facilitating a more efficient design and testing process.

## Features

- **List All Open Windows**: Displays all currently open windows in a ListView, providing a clear overview of active applications.
- **Restore Minimized Windows**: Automatically restores and displays any minimized window, ensuring easy access to all applications without manually maximizing them.
